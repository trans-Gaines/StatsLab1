Problems

X <- c(1,4,3,2,5,4,3,6,7,8)

Y <- c(1,3,6,7,8,2,8,7,6,9)

**1. An X and Y variable contain the above numbers.**

**A. Compute Pearson’s 𝑟 and report the associated p-value using the cor.test() function. (2 points)**

##Create Variables
```{r}
Xlab11 <- c(1,4,3,2,5,4,3,6,7,8)
Ylab11 <- c(1,3,6,7,8,2,8,7,6,9)
```

##Cor.test
```{r}
cor.test(Xlab11,Ylab11)
```

Pearson's r = 0.51, p-value is .13

*Self-Assesment: 100*

**B. Use a permutation test to create a null-distribution, and report the p-value for getting the observed correlation or larger using your simulated null-distribution. (2 points)**

```{r}
##Generate null dist of r values
rand_1000 <- replicate(10000,cor(sample(Xlab11),sample(Ylab11)))
hist(rand_1000)
##Generate p value for previous finding based on this null dist
length(rand_1000[rand_1000 >= cor(Xlab11,Ylab11)])/10000
```

*Self-Assesment: 60*

**2. Using the variables X and Y above, and assuming that the values could be re-ordered in any way, report the following:**
**A. the smallest possible sum of cross-products (1 point)**


##What is the sum of cross products now?
```{r}
sum(Xlab11*Ylab11)
```

##Reorder x to smallest to largest, Y largest to smallest, compute cross product
```{r}
sum(sort(Xlab11)*sort(Ylab11, decreasing = TRUE))
```

192 is the smallest possible

*Self-Assesment: 70*

**B. the largest possible sum of cross-products (1 point)**

##Sort both descending
```{r}
sum(sort(Xlab11)*sort(Ylab11, decreasing = FALSE))
```
The largest possible sum of cross-products is 295

*Self-Assesment: 100*
